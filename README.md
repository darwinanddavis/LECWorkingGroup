Ideas behind this research were developed at the Living Earth Collaborative working group on the effects of parasites on ecosystem nutrient cycling, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA, December 4-7, 2018.    

## Overview    

Develop a predictive framework for estimating indirect effects of parasites on ecosystem nutrient cycling. Using ungulates and their parasites as a model, we hope to: (1) Assemble a dataset on the type, direction, and magnitude of effects of parasites on ungulates, focusing on key behavioral, physiological, and demographic effects with ecosystem-level implications; (2) Integrate two distinct modeling approaches (Dynamic Energy Budget and Energetic Food Web) to explore the consequences of the effects of parasites; and (3) Use a trait-based approach to develop general predictions for how diverse types of parasites (e.g., acute vs. chronic, virulent vs. sub-lethal) may affect ecosystem function.  

## Instructions for running the model    

:one: Download the model instructions document.  
:two: Open and run the simulation model in `R`.
