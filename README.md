## Overview    

Develop a predictive framework for estimating indirect effects of parasites on ecosystem nutrient cycling. Ideas behind this research were developed at the Living Earth Collaborative working group on the effects of parasites on ecosystem nutrient cycling, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA, December 4-7, 2018.      

## Instructions for running the model    

:one: Download `R` and `RStudio`.    
:two: [Download the model file (right click here and 'Save link as')](https://github.com/darwinanddavis/LECWorkingGroup/raw/master/NPSI.R) and run the simulation model in `RStudio`.  
:three: Follow the instructions at the beginning of the `R` file to run the model.        

## Troubleshooting  

All troubleshooting and bugs can be sent as a git issue or to matthew.malishev [at] emory.edu.
